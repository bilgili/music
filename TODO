* Allow different time steps

* Implement mark function in FIBO

* Buffering schedule in synchronizer

* Move all MPI implementation dependent code into a subdirectory
  mpidep.  This directory should also contain a test binary which is
  built and run before anything else is being compiled

* Write piecewise_linear_index and derive linear_index and
  permutation_index from it.

* Improve all error reporting (giving more informative messages with names etc)
