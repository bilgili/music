* error message on startup with wrong number of processes

* error message binary not found

* error message configuration file not found

* report port name if missing

* Marshalling i contsubconnector

* alternative implementation for clockstate (not long long)

* Error check in map: MPI::Type not float or double

* continuous loops

* Code duplication sampler - distributor - collector - kommentarer

* optional arguments when mapping ports: maxbuffered but not latency
   
* error message if latency => > maxBuffered
   
* indexinterval::local --> offset

* Use pass-by-reference ubstead of pass-by-value where possible
  (especially for some strings)

* Check that all administrative objects get deallocated at start of runtime
  (for example TemporalNegotiator)

* cleanup constructor arguments in subconnector.cc

* marshalling, for example in temporal.cc, subconnector.cc

Before delivery

* Documentation strings

After delivery

* Debian packaging

Optional
  
* Improve all error reporting (giving more informative messages with names etc)

* Set flags with options to the music utility and transmit them to the
  applications so that library behavior can be controlled.  E.g.,
  print out run statistics, such as part of time spent in tick() when
  deleting runtime.

* Option for music launcher to get map over rank allocations

* Join intervals at spatial negotiation.

* Join intervals in PermutationIndex and IndexMapFactory

* Move all MPI implementation dependent code into a subdirectory
  mpidep.  This directory should also contain a test binary which is
  built and run before anything else is being compiled

* Write piecewise_linear_index and derive linear_index and
  permutation_index from it.
