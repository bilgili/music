* Allow different time steps

* Join intervals at spatial negotiation.

* Implement mark function in FIBO

* Buffering schedule in synchronizer

* Move all MPI implementation dependent code into a subdirectory
  mpidep.  This directory should also contain a test binary which is
  built and run before anything else is being compiled

* Write piecewise_linear_index and derive linear_index and
  permutation_index from it.

* Improve all error reporting (giving more informative messages with names etc)

* Option for music launcer to get map over rank allocations

* Set flags with options to the music utility and transmit them to the
  applications so that library behavior can be controlled.  E.g.,
  print out run statistics, such as part of time spent in tick() when
  deleting runtime.
