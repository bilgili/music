* Manual:

** Are all manual-related points in Hans Plesser's revision to the RFC
   considered?

** No, they are not: We need to document the usage of
   runtime->finalize ().  (This is where MUSIC does flushes data and
   calls MPI::Finalize ().  The flushing of data needs to be
   documented.

** Is the API described in the manual consistent with the header files?

** Clearify usage of tick ().  What data from what time-step is sent
   and received by which tick?

** Did we promise Raphael some addition to the manual during one of
   our meetings?

* error message if latency => > maxBuffered
   
* indexinterval::local --> offset

* Use pass-by-reference ubstead of pass-by-value where possible
  (especially for some strings)

* Check that all administrative objects get deallocated at start of runtime
  (for example TemporalNegotiator)

* Buffering schedule in synchronizer

* cleanup constructor arguments in subconnector.cc

* marshalling, for example in temporal.cc, subconnector.cc

Continuous data

* Investigate what needs to be done

Before delivery

* Communicate timing parameters between group leaders

* Run loop detection algorithm in group leaders

* Distribute timing constraint data to all ranks

* Documentation strings

* Document finalize ()

After delivery

* Debian packaging

Optional
  
* Improve all error reporting (giving more informative messages with names etc)

* Set flags with options to the music utility and transmit them to the
  applications so that library behavior can be controlled.  E.g.,
  print out run statistics, such as part of time spent in tick() when
  deleting runtime.

* Option for music launcer to get map over rank allocations

* Join intervals at spatial negotiation.

* Move all MPI implementation dependent code into a subdirectory
  mpidep.  This directory should also contain a test binary which is
  built and run before anything else is being compiled

* Write piecewise_linear_index and derive linear_index and
  permutation_index from it.

Obscure

* Implement mark function in FIBO
