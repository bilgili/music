Description: MUSIC Multi-Simulation Coordinator -- Development files
 Large scale neural network simulator data exchange framework.

 MUSIC allows spike events and continuous time series to be
 communicated between applications in a cluster computer. The typical
 usage cases are connecting models developed for different simulators
 and connecting a parallel simulator to a post-processing tool.

 This package contains the header files which are needed to compile
 and link programs against libmusic1.
