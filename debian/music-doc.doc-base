Title: MUSIC Manual
Author: Ã–rjan Ekeberg and Mikael Djurfeldt
Abstract: MUSIC is an API allowing large scale neuron simulators using MPI
  internally to exchange data during runtime.  MUSIC provides
  mechanisms to transfer massive amounts of event information and
  continuous values from one parallel application to another.  Special
  care has been taken to ensure that existing simulators can be
  adapted to MUSIC.  In particular, MUSIC handles data transfer
  between applications that use different time steps and different
  data allocation strategies.
