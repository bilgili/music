\title{MUSIC --- Multi-Simulation Coordinator\\
  Provisional Specification}

\author{Örjan Ekeberg and Mikael Djurfeldt}

\maketitle

\begin{abstract}
  MUSIC is an API allowing large scale neuron simulators using MPI
  internally to exchange data during runtime.  MUSIC provides
  mechanisms to transfer massive amounts of event information and
  continuous values from one parallel application to another.  Special
  care has been taken to ensure that existing simulators can be
  adapted to MUSIC.  In particular, MUSIC handles data transfer
  between applications that use different time steps and different
  data allocation strategies.

\chapter{Introduction}

\section{Scope}

MUSIC is a standard for run-time exchange of data between parallel
applications in a cluster environment.  The standard is designed
specifically for interconnecting large scale neuronal network
simulators, either with each-other or with other tools.

A typical usage case is illustrated in figure~\ref{fig:multisim},
where three applications ($A$, $B$, and $C$) are executing in parallel
while exchanging data via MUSIC.  We will refer to this as a
\emph{multi-simulation}, since the participating applications are
typically neuronal simulators, or tools to support such simulators.
In this example, application $A$ produces runtime data which is then
used by $B$ and $C$.  In addition, $B$ and $C$ mutually send data to
each other.  The data sent between applications can be either event
based, such as neuronal spikes, or graded continuous values, for
example membrane voltages.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.5\textwidth]{figures/multisim}
    \caption[Typical multi-simulation]{\label{fig:multisim}
      Illustration of a typical multi-simulation using MUSIC.  Three
      applications, $A$, $B$, and $C$, are exchanging data during
      runtime.
    }
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

The primary objective of MUSIC is to support multi-simulations where
each participating application itself is a parallel simulator with the
capacity to produce and/or consume massive amounts of data.  The fact
that data is spread out over a number of processors makes it
non-trivial to coordinate the transfer of data so that it reaches the
right destination at the right time.  The task for MUSIC is to relieve
the applications from handling this complexity.


\section{Design Goals}

\subsection{Portability}

The MUSIC library and support software have been designed to run
smoothly on state-of-the-art high-performance hardware.  For maximal
portability, the software is written in C++, which is the
defacto-standard for current high-end hardware.  MUSIC also provides a
pure C-interface, making it possible for applications written i C or
FORTRAN to participate in a MUSIC multi-simulation.

Most, if not all, current efforts in large scale neuronal simulations
are based on the MPI\index{MPI} standard.  MUSIC is built on top of
MPI, and uses it to run the different simulators.  MPI encapsulates
software optimizations for specific hardware, and by basing the
interface on MPI we can benefit from such optimizations.  In
addition, MUSIC provides means to allow each simulator to use MPI
internally without interfering with the others.

During the development of MUSIC we have used two reference platforms:
Intel-based multi-core workstations and the IBM
BlueGene/L\index{BlueGene/L}\index{IBM BlueGene} supercomputer.  These
platforms can be considered as two extremes, where the multi-core
machine represents a small parallel environment while the BlueGene/L
represents a large scale parallel supercomputer with special
requirements.  In particular, the compute nodes on the BlueGene/L do
not support multiple threads or processes.


\subsection{Simplicity}

For MUSIC to be useful, it must be possible to adapt existing
simulators so that they can participate in a multi-simulation without
too much effort.  We rely on the simulator developers to make these
adaptations.  An important design goal has therefore been to adapt the
design to the typical structure of current simulators.  It should be
possible to add usage of the MUSIC library without invasive
restructuring of the existing simulator.

The requirements on an application using MUSIC is primarily that it,
during the setup phase, declares what data should be exported and
imported, and that it repeatedly calls a function at regular intervals
during the simulation to allow MUSIC to make the actual data transfer.


\subsection{Independence}

The MUSIC interface ensures that each individual application does not
need special adaptation to specific properties of other applications.
The application only needs to adhere to the specification of the MUSIC
interface in order to communicate with other applications performing
complementary tasks.  This makes the development of MUSIC-aware
software independent of what other applications it will communicate
with.

We hope that this will facilitate the development of general purpose
tools.  For example, a researcher can develop a tool for calculating
synthetic EEG from simulation data.  Via MUSIC, this tool should then
be useful for anybody using any neuronal simulator which supports the
common MUSIC interface.


\section{Terminology}

\begin{description}
\item[application] We use the term
  \emph{application}\index{application} to denote a simulator or other
  program interfaced to MUSIC.  Each application is a parallel
  program, normally running on several processors.

\item[multi-simulation] We use the term
  \emph{multi-simulation}\index{multi-simulation} to refer to the
  whole parallel execution of multiple applications coordinated by
  MUSIC.

\item[port] Each application declares its ability to produce and
  consume data by publishing \emph{ports}\index{port}.  Ports are
  named by the application along with information about the datatype
  and mapping onto different processors.  Ports are either
  \lstinline|input_ports|\index{input port} or
  \lstinline|output_ports|\index{output port}.

\item[connection] During the setup phase, MUSIC connects pairs of
  ports together to form \emph{connections}\index{connection}.  During
  the runtime phase, data is transferred over the connection from the
  producer of the data to the consumer.

\item[map] Map\index{map} is a data structure used to keep track of
  the layout of data within an application.  Data to be transferred
  over a connection can be regarded as a large array distributed over
  multiple processors.  The map contains information about which
  processor has each element of data, and where the element is stored.

\item[ticks] During the runtime phase, all processes in each
  application must make a \emph{tick}\index{tick} call at regular
  intervals in simulated time.  At these tick points, MUSIC is allowed
  to use MPI to transfer the data between processors.
\end{description}


\section{Relation to Existing Software}

MUSIC is not the only software project aiming to support the
inter-operability between neural simulators.  In this section we will
briefly describe some related projects and specifically focus on how
they relate to MUSIC.

\paragraph{PyNN}\index{PyNN}

PyNN is a Python package for simulator-independent specification of
neuronal network models.  It consists of a low-level procedural API
and a high-level object-oriented API.  Neuronal network models
described using these API:s can be simulated on simulators supporting
API, such as Neuron and NEST.

PyNN can be extended to support multi-simulations using the MUSIC
library.  Such extensions would control the interaction between the
simulator and the MUSIC library and would, for example, support
publishing of named ports.

\begin{metatext}
  För mycket would här!
\end{metatext}

It is possible, in principle, to write Python code to directly handle
communication between applications in a cluster, but such a solution
would be very inefficient compared to using MUSIC, and would, in the
end, have to address the same problems which MUSIC provides a solution
to.

\chapter{Execution Model}

\section{Phases of Execution}

A multi-simulation, i.e. a set of interconnected parallel
applications, is executed in three distinct phases:
\begin{description}
\item[\textbf{Launch}]\index{launch phase} is the phase where all the
  applications are started on the processors.  During this phase,
  MUSIC is responsible for distributing and launching the application
  binaries on the set of MPI processes allocated to the MUSIC job.
  This has to be done before MPI is initialized and therefore has to
  be handled separately for different MPI implementations.

  Technically, the launch phase begins when \texttt{mpirun} launches
  the MUSIC binary and ends when the setup object constructor returns.

\item[\textbf{Setup}]\index{setup phase} is the phase when all
  applications must publish what ports they are prepared to handle,
  the time step they will use, and where data will be present (where
  in memory and/or on what processor).  During the setup phase, the
  applications can read configuration parameters communicated via the
  common configuration file.

  The setup phase begins when the setup object has been created and
  ends when the runtime object constructor returns.

\item[\textbf{Runtime}]\index{runtime phase} is the phase then
  simulation data is actually transferred between applications.  Via
  the \texttt{tick} calls the simulated time of the applications are
  kept in order.

  The runtime phase begins when the runtime object has been created
  and ends when the runtime object is destroyed.
\end{description}

From the application programmers point of view, these phases are
clearly separated through the use of the two main components of the
MUSIC interface: the \emph{setup} and the \emph{runtime} object.  The
launch phase is not visible for the application since it handles the
situation before the application starts.

When the application initializes MUSIC at the beginning of execution
it receives a specific \emph{setup object}.  This object gives access
to the functionality relevant during the setup phase via its methods.
When done with the setup, the application program makes the transition
to the runtime phase by calling a method in the setup object which
destroys the setup object and returns a \emph{runtime object}.  This
runtime object provides methods relevant during the runtime phase of
execution.


\section{Concepts}

The \lstinline|index_map| maps indices local to the MPI process to global
indices within the distributed data array.  That is, the
\lstinline|index_map| tells which parts of a distributed data array are
handled by the local process and how the data elements are locally
ordered.

\section{Spatial Distribution of Data}
\responsible{Mikael}

Consider a connection between two ports.  Both the output and input
connectors can have arbitrary ordering of data.  How do output and
input connectors know the rank

Refer to figure~\ref{fig:datamapping}.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \includegraphics[width=0.7\textwidth]{figures/datamapping}
    \caption[Mapping of data]{\label{fig:datamapping}
      Data transfer over a connection from an application running on
      four processors to an application running on three other.
    }
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

\section{Timing Considerations}
\label{sec:timing}
  
Different applications may use different time steps and it is the
responsibility of MUSIC to ensure that data is delivered at the
appropriate time.  In order to minimize handshaking, both parts of a
connection pair locally calculate when the actual data transfer over
MPI takes place.  To ensure that these calculations produce
predictable results, simulation time is represented using integers
with a global micro-timestep\index{micro-timestep} common for all
applications.

Simulation time\index{simulation time} is local for each application
and MUSIC does not enforce unnecessary synchronization between these
local clocks.  Thus, an application producing data may be running
ahead of another application which consumes the same data.  MUSIC
internally builds a schedule which ensures that data arrives at the
appropriate local time in the receiving application.  Scheduling
becomes more complex when data is not only transferred in a
feed-forward manner, i.e. the connection graph contains loops.  In
this case MUSIC has to rely on the existence of sufficient delays in
the simulated model, typically corresponding to axonal
delays\index{axonal delay}.

\begin{figure}
  \begin{center}
    \begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/ticklogic}
      \caption[Timing of data transfer, slowdown]{\label{fig:timingshorter}
        Transfer of data when sender has a shorter
        tick interval than the receiver}
    \end{minipage}
    \hfill
    \begin{minipage}{0.45\textwidth}
      \includegraphics[width=\textwidth]{figures/ticklogic2}
      \caption[Timing of data transfer, speedup]{\label{fig:timinglonger}
        Transfer of data when sender has a longer
        tick interval than the receiver}
    \end{minipage}
  \end{center}
\end{figure}

Figures~\ref{fig:timingshorter} and \ref{fig:timinglonger} illustrate
how MUSIC handles time when transferring continuous data over a connection.
In figure~\ref{fig:timingshorter}, the sender application uses a
shorter interval between the tick calls than the receiver.  The sender
side uses values sampled at the tick points to calculate a value
corresponding to the point in time when the receiver makes its tick
call.

The dark middle are (labelled ``MPI'') is where the actual data
transfer takes place.  MUSIC makes use of the fact that the receiving
application can run with its simulation clock set independently of the
sender.  The arrows going ``backwards in time'' in this area reflect
the fact that the receivers clock is lagging.  This makes it possible
for data to arrive in time despite the fact that it was available
later than when it was arriving.

Figure~\ref{fig:timinglonger} illustrates what happens when the
receiver is calling tick faster then the sender.  The sender will then
have to buffer up multiple values to be transferred at a suitable tick
call, and the receiver will portion these values out at the
appropriate ticks.

The strategy of having the receiver application running with a delayed
local clock only works when the connection graph forms a directed
acyclic graph (DAG).  When loops occur it is necessary to allow for
data arriving late, at least somewhere along each loop.  MUSIC handles
this via \emph{acceptable latency}\index{acceptable
  latency}\index{latency} which is a property of each input port.  The
receiving application declares how late data may arrive, thus giving
MUSIC room for resolving the scheduling problem.


\section{Application Responsibilities}

\begin{itemize}
\item Call setup
\item Create ports
\item Map ports to data or callback functions
\item Inform MUSIC about the communication interval
\item Call tick at regular intervals
\end{itemize}


\chapter{Starting a Multi-Simulation}

\section{Overview}

Parallel programs based on MPI are normally started by running a
special program called \texttt{mpirun} (for MPI-1) or \texttt{mpiexec}
(for MPI-2).  To start multiple applications and enable them to
communicate with each other, MUSIC utilizes a special launcher program
called \texttt{music}\index{music} which, in turn, starts the
different applications.  Information about which applications should
be started, and the communication pattern between them is described in
a common \emph{configuration file}\index{configuration file}.


\section{The Configuration File}

The main purpose of the configuration file is to control what
applications to start, and to connect output ports to input ports.
The configuration file specifies the number of processors allocated to
each application.

Arbitrary named parameters may also be included in the configuration
file and these parameters can be accessed from the applications.  This
will typically be the way names of script files and other information
is passed to the applications.  In particular, the normal command line
arguments can be set this way.

Optionally, the width of the connections between application can be
specified.


\chapter{Application Program Interface}

\section{Setup}
\responsible{Mikael}

\subsection{The setup constructor}

Each application initializes the MUSIC library through a call to the
setup constructor.  This constructor, in turn, calls MPI::Init to
initialize MPI.  The setup constructor creates the setup object
through which the application can retrieve configuration information,
get a communicator, and setup ports.

\begin{head}{setup}
  setup::setup (int& argc, char**& argv)
\end{head}
\begin{parameters}
  \lstinline|argc| &%
  reference to the \lstinline|argc| argument of \lstinline|main| \\
  \lstinline|argv| &%
  reference to the \lstinline|argv| argument of \lstinline|main| \\
\end{parameters}

This constructor must be called at most once; subsequent calls are
erroneous.  It accepts the \lstinline|argc| and \lstinline|argv| that are
provided by the arguments to \lstinline|main|.

\begin{code}{Initializing MUSIC}
int main (int argc, char *argv[])
{
  MUSIC::setup* setup = new MUSIC::setup (argc, argv);

  /* parse arguments */
  /* rest of program */
}
\end{code}

\subsection{Communicators}

During a multi-simulation, launched using the \lstinline|music| utility
command, the music library will create a unique intra-communicator
over the group of processes assigned to the application.  This
communicator is retrieved from the setup object through a call to the
\lstinline|communicator| method.

\begin{head}{communicator}
  MPI::Intracomm setup::communicator ()
\end{head}
\begin{parameters}
  \emph{return value} & the application communicator \\
\end{parameters}

The application is supposed to use the communicator returned by
\lstinline|communicator| in place of \lstinline|MPI::COMM_WORLD|.  This
communicator can be used as any ordinary MPI communicator.

\begin{code}{Accessing the application-wide communicator}
/* communicator with global scope */
extern MPI_Comm comm;

...
{
  ...
  comm = setup->communicator ();
  int rank = comm.Get_rank ();
  ...
}
\end{code}

\subsection{Port creation}

Ports are named sources (output ports) or sinks (input ports) of data
flows.  Output and input ports are distinct classes.  Ports are
further subdivided into distinct classes depending on whether they
handle continuous or event data.

\begin{head}{publish_output,publish_input}
  cont_output_port* setup::publish_cont_output (string identifier)

  cont_input_port* setup::publish_cont_input (string identifier)

  event_output_port* setup::publish_event_output (string identifier)

  event_input_port* setup::publish_event_input (string identifier)
\end{head}
\begin{parameters}
  \lstinline|identifier| & port name \\
  \emph{return value} & an empty port \\
\end{parameters}

Ports have two stages in life: the \emph{empty} stage and the
\emph{mapped} stage.  A port is empty when created.  The MUSIC
configuration file specifies connections between ports.  It is
possible to ask an empty port if it is connected, if it has a
specified width and what width it has if this width is specified.  A port
becomes mapped when its method \lstinline|map| is called with a datamap.

\begin{code}{Creating an empty port}
cont_output_port* out = setup->publish_cont_output ("out");
\end{code}

\subsection{Port methods}

The port API includes methods to ask a port if it is connected, if it
has a specified width and what width it has if this width is
specified.  A port becomes mapped when its method \lstinline|map| is
called with a datamap.

\subsubsection{Port connectivity}

The method \lstinline|is_connected| is used to check if the user has
specified a connection of this port to another port in the
configuration file.

\begin{head}{is_connected}
  bool port::is_connected ()
\end{head}
\begin{parameters}
  \emph{return value} & \lstinline|true| only if connected\\
\end{parameters}

This method is typically used in cases where the use of some of the
ports of the application is optional.  In such a case, it is not
sensible to allocate any application resources to support the data
flow in question.  One example is if one wants to support output of
membrane potentials from a certain population of cells, but don't want
to waste resources if no one is listening.

\begin{code}{Optional handling of ports}
cont_output_port* out = setup->publish_cont_output ("Vm");
/* map port only if anyone is listening */
if (out->is_connected ())
  /* allocate application resources and map port */
\end{code}

\subsubsection{Port width}
\label{sec:width}

The width of a port, that is the number of data elements transferred
in parallel from a cont port or the largest possible id of an event
port $+ 1$, can be specified in the configuration file. This should be
thought of as a request for a given width.  Applications can use the
method \lstinline|has_width| to determine if a width has been
specified and retrieve the width using \lstinline|width|.

\begin{head}{has_width}
  bool port::has_width ()
\end{head}
\begin{parameters}
  \emph{return value} & \lstinline|true| only if port width has been
                         specified \\
\end{parameters}


\begin{head}{width}
  int port::width ()
\end{head}
\begin{parameters}
  \emph{return value} & port width \\
\end{parameters}

Applications can use the above methods to adapt their port size.  See
example \ref{code:adaptivewidth}.

\subsubsection{Mapping a port}

\begin{head}{map}
  void cont_output_port::map (cont_data* dmap)

  void cont_input_port::map (cont_data* dmap)

  void event_output_port::map (event_data* dmap)

  void event_input_port::map (event_data* dmap, double acc_latency)
\end{head}
\begin{parameters}
  \lstinline|map| & the data map associated with the port \\
  \lstinline|acc_latency| & acceptable latency for incoming data (s)
  \\
\end{parameters}

The data map holds information about how data elements are distributed
in memory.  See section \ref{sec:datamap} below.

Some spiking neural network models include axonal delays.  The MUSIC
framework assumes that handling and delivery of delayed spikes occurs
on the receiver side.  In such a case, the receiver may allow MUSIC to
deliver a spike event later than its time stamp according to local
time.  The maximal acceptable latency is specified through the
\lstinline|acc_latency| argument.
  
\begin{rationale}
The current RFC only specifies acceptable latency for event input
ports only.  As discussed in section \ref{sec:timing} this allows for
applications to be connected in loops with regard to spiking
communication, while no loops are allowed with regard to continuous
data.
\end{rationale}

\begin{code}{Mapping ports to internal data}
{
  ...
  int size = comm.Get_size ();
  int rank = comm.Get_rank ();
  /* for clarity we assume that n_elements is a multiple of size */
  int n_local = n_elements / size;
  double* data_buffer = new double[n_local];
  MUSIC::cont_input_port* out = setup->publish_cont_output ("out");
  array_data dmap (data_buffer, MPI::DOUBLE, n_rank * n_local, n_local);
  out->map (&dmap);
  ...
}
\end{code}

Some applications, for example those who provide some kind of more
generic processing, like a visualization application, may want to be
able to accept input of any width.  This can be achieved using the
methods described in section \ref{sec:width}:

\begin{code}{Publishing port of adaptive width\label{code:adaptivewidth}}
{
  ...
  /* Publishing a port of adaptive width */
  double* data_buffer;
  MUSIC::cont_input_port* in = setup->publish_cont_input ("in");
  if (!in->has_width ())
    /* report error */
  else
    {
      /* for clarity we assume that n_elements is a multiple of size */
      int size = in->width ();
      int n_local = n_elements / size;
      /* example continues as above */
      ...
      
    }
}
\end{code}

\subsection{Data maps}
\label{sec:datamap}

\subsection{Index maps}

\subsection{Configuration variables}

\begin{head}{config}
  bool config (string var, string* result)

  bool config (string var, int* result)

  bool config (string var, double* result)
\end{head}
\begin{parameters}
  \lstinline|var| & \\
  \lstinline|result| & \\
  \emph{return value} & \\
\end{parameters}

\begin{code}{Querying configuration variables}
  /* Add example here */
\end{code}

\section{Runtime}

\subsection{tick ()}

Called in the local simulation loop of each application.
The interface may, or may not, exchange data with other applications
at the tick call.

The application must ensure that exported data values are valid when
tick() is called.  It must also expect that imported values may change.

The tick() should be called at regular intervals in simulation time.
The application chooses the interval, normally based on the time step
used in the application.  The interface must handle that different
applications can use different tick-intervals.


\subsection{Aliasing}

The interface should take care of spatial and temporal aliasing, that
is, to interpolate in space and time when the space and time steps of
two applications do not match.

To minimize communication, we always want to do the conversion on the
side which has the most dense data.

\paragraph{Motivation:} The application or model should not have to be
adapted to the steps used in other applications.


\subsubsection{Filters on sender side}

When the receiver of a data-flow has a longer tick-interval than the
receiver, then filters can be engaged to compress, smoothen, average,
or otherwise aggregate the data before transmission.

\begin{rationale}
  Filtering is needed on the sender side.  If we connect an existing
  simulation with a receiver with longer time step, we don't want to
  rewrite the simulation code to perform filtering.  Thus, the
  interface must support filtering.
\end{rationale}


\subsubsection{Interpolation on receiver side}

Needed when sender is slower than receiver.

Note that to make it possible to do interpolation, the sender has to
produce the next value before the receiver can enter the intermediate
time interval.  This needs careful scheduling of the transmissions to
avoid dead-lock situations.

\chapter{A Complete Example}

This chapter shows a minimal but still complete example.  It consists
of two applications, \texttt{waveproducer} and \texttt{waveconsumer},
and a configuration file used to launch and connect them.

\chapter{Notes}

\section{Data Structures}

\begin{description}
  \item[setup] Used to ask for configuration information and create
    ports.
  \item[runtime] Used during simulation.  Provides the \lstinline|tick ()|
    method.
  \item[port] A \lstinline|port| is the interface used to send or receive
    data from other applications.  It can be distributed over many MPI
    processes.  A port contains a \lstinline|datamap|.  There are
    \lstinline|output_port|s and \lstinline|input_port|s.
  \item[connector] An internal datastructure which represents the
    sending or receiving end of a connection between two ports.  An
    \lstinline|output_port| can have multiple connectors while an
    \lstinline|input_port| can have only one.
  \item[data\_map] Defines the data to be communicated through the
    port.  A data\_map consists of a pointer to the memory location
    containing the data (for continuous-valued data) and an
    index\_map.
  \item[index\_map] Defines which global indices are handled in the
    local MPI process and how they are organized in memory.
\end{description}

\subsection{Ports}

\subsection{Connectors}

A connector has at least the following components:
\begin{itemize}
  \item an inter-communicator
  \item a buffer for continuous data
  \item a remap strategy
\end{itemize}

A connector does \emph{not} support re-computation of spike time
stamps, i.e., it does not provide axonal delays.  Instead, it is
recommended that the receiver takes care of such delays.

A connected pair of an output connector and an input connector
constitutes a MUSIC \emph{connection}.

\subsection{Data maps}

\subsection{Index maps}

\lstinline|linear_map| can be implemented in terms of
\lstinline|permutation_map| which is the most general form of index map.

and \lstinline|argv| are passed by reference to the \lstinline|setup|
constructor which may modify these variables.  The setup constructor
calls MPI:Init for the application.

\begin{rationale}
  The idea here is to replace the call to MPI:Init with a call to the
  setup constructor.  This way, it is not possible to forget to call
  an extra initialization routine.
\end{rationale}

The setup object is then used to query about configuration
information, to get the local communicator, and to create ports.

There should be no need to link an application differently when it is
used together with other applications in a MUSIC setting compared to
when it is used in a stand-alone setting.  In order to support
``standard'' operation for the application,
\lstinline|setup::communicator ()|, therefore, will return
MPI::COMM\_WORLD if the job is started directly with
\lstinline|mpirun| instead of with the MUSIC launcher.

Calling \lstinline|setup::done ()| will implicitly call the
\lstinline|runtime| object constructor.

During simulation, the application should repeatedly call
\lstinline|runtime::tick ()|.  This is typically done at each simulation
time step.

\section{Timing Considerations}

During a MUSIC simulation data is communicated between two connectors
by pairwise blocking communication.  Both sends and receives occur
within a \lstinline|tick ()| call.

\subsection{Global clock}

Connector pairs do not necessarily communicate at every tick.  It is
therefore important that both sender and receiver know when to
communicate.  In order to determine this deterministically MUSIC uses
an internal global integer clock.  Application specific tick intervals
are translated to an integral number of global clock time steps using
the MUSIC \emph{timebase}.  The timebase can be specified in the
configuration file using the variable name ``timebase''.  The default
value is 1 ns.

The reference implementation uses a 64-bit integer to represent the
global clock.

\begin{rationale}
  \emph{Discuss indeterminacy of floating-point arithmetic, in particular
    with regard to re-ordering of arithmetic operations by the compiler.}
\end{rationale}

\subsection{Time zone difference}

Minimal latency

\subsection{Communication schedule}

The order of calls to \lstinline|MPI::Send| and \lstinline|MPI::Receive| within
output and input connectors can be important.  Consider two
connections between the same pair of applications.  If application 1
sends on output connectors A and B in sequence, within the same tick,
while application 2 receives on the corresponding input connectors in
reverse order (B, A) there will be a dead-lock.

Such dead-lock:s are avoided by imposing a fixed pairwise
communication schedule.  The setup phase creates and sorts output and
input connectors into a vector according to this schedule.  This
vector is passed to the runtime object.  At each \lstinline|tick ()|, the
runtime object iterates through the vector, giving each connector an
opportunity to communicate.

\subsection{Initialization}

Before calling \lstinline|setup::done ()| at the end of the setup phase,
the user must initialize all data associated to output ports through
datamap:s.  During \lstinline|setup::done ()|, this data is transferred to
all input ports.  This is so that data can subsequently be correctly
interpolated.
