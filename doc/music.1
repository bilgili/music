.SH NAME
music \- launch a multi-simulation using MUSIC
.SH SYNOPSIS
.B mpirun
.RI [ mpirun-options ]
.B  music
.RI [ options ] " config"
.br
.B music
.RI [ options ] " config" ...
.SH DESCRIPTION
This manual page documents briefly the
.B music
utility.
.PP
.\" TeX users may be more comfortable with the \fB<whatever>\fP and
.\" \fI<whatever>\fP escape sequences to invode bold face and italics,
.\" respectively.
\fBmusic\fP is used to launch a multi-simulation, i.e., an MPI job
partitioned between a set of parallel programs.  Such programs need to
be MUSIC-aware (see documentation for the MUSIC library).  MUSIC also
provides facilities for these programs to exchange data.
.PP
The second form of the command above (without \fBmpirun\fP) can be
used to print out an application rank map or version information.
.SH OPTIONS
The
.B music
utility follows the usual GNU command line syntax, with long
options starting with two dashes (`-').
A summary of options is included below.
For a complete description, see the MUSIC manual.
