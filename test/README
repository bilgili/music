This directory contains a number of small sample programs and scripts
to run them.

* Demos

demo.music
   Random spikes are generated from a 3-process application and
   sent to a graphics visualizer.

   $ mpirun -np 4 music demo.music


demolarge.music
   Similar to demo.music, but running a larger example on more
   processors.  20 processes are started by this demo.

   $ mpirun -np 20 music demolarge.music


* Event communication

events.music
   Spikes are sent from a sending to a receiving application.

   $ mpirun -np 4 music events.music


fork.music
   Spikes are sent from one sender to two receiving applications.

   $ mpirun -np 6 music fork.music


chain.music
   Spikes are sent from one sender (running in two processes) to
   a receiver via an intermediate application which serves as a delay.

   $ mpirun -np 4 music chain.music


loop.music
   Spikes are sent into a loop of two mutually interconnected
   applications tha both delay and then pass spikes on.

   $ mpirun -np 4 music loop.music


* Continuous communication

const.music
   A constant array of data is sent to a distributed receiving application.

   $ mpirun -np 4 music const.music


contclock.music
   The current simulation time is sent as a test output from one
   application and received by another.

   $ mpirun -np 2 music contclock.music


cloop.music
   The time signal is sent into a delay loop where values are
   gradually accumulated.

   $ mpirun -np 4 music cloop.music
